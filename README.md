# Simple-As-Possible-SAP-8-bit-computer-using-Proteus
The simple 8-bit computer architecture known as the SAP-1 can be built using discrete components. The creation of a computer with more bits will benefit from this elementary school effort.

## PROJECT:

SAP, which stands for - Simple as possible.These kind of computers were first introduced by Albert Paul Malvino and Jerald A.Brown. Three types of SAP are there. These are SAP-1 SAP-2 SAP-3. This architecture follows the same fundamentals of modern computers.

This architecture comprises of three units; a processing unit, a control unit and also a memory unit that holds the data and the instructions. This architecture is like a basic computer.

And below is our version of SAP-1 done as a university project; under Islamic University of Technology (IUT).

### Introduction:

There is only one ic present in the sap that we made which is a 555 timer. All other systems were created by basic AND OR NOR NAND NOT gates.

One special feature of our project is we reduced the t states from 6 to 4.

Another special feature we built a 8-bit binary to 3 bit BCD display.

The most interesting fact is that when if we subtract bigger number from smaller number, we can also show minus ‘-’ sign in the display.
